# Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) Project

## Project Overview
The **Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) and Campaign Analysis** project aims to evaluate the impact of various marketing channels and campaign strategies on customer acquisition, sales, and overall business performance. Using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, the project provides data-driven insights into optimizing marketing expenditures.

## Objectives
- Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on customer demographics, marketing channels, and sales data.
- Perform **Hypothesis Testing** to determine the significance of different factors on customer acquisition.
- Build **Marketing Mix Models** to quantify the impact of various marketing investments.
- Provide actionable insights to optimize **campaign strategies and budget allocation**.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes multiple datasets containing information on:
- **Customer demographics**: Birth year, education, income, expenditure
- **Marketing channels**: Digital ads, social media, TV, radio, print
- **Promotion campaigns**: Discounts, loyalty programs, referral incentives
- **Sales performance**: Transactions, revenue, conversion rates

## Methodology
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Feature engineering for improved model performance

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution analysis of key variables
- Correlation analysis between marketing channels and sales
- Visualizations for better insights

### 3. Hypothesis Testing
- A/B testing for evaluating marketing effectiveness
- Statistical significance tests to validate key assumptions

### 4. Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)
- Implementing **OLS regression** to estimate channel effectiveness
- Applying **Bayesian modeling** for robust predictions
- Handling **carryover and saturation effects**

### 5. Insights & Recommendations
- Identifying **high-ROI marketing channels**
- Optimizing marketing budget allocation
- Suggesting **strategies for future campaigns**

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Statistical Methods**: Regression Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Bayesian Modeling

## Results & Key Findings
- **Top-performing marketing channels**: Social media and digital ads showed the highest ROI.
- **Campaign effectiveness**: Referral programs had a significant impact on customer acquisition.
- **Budget reallocation insights**: Suggested shifting funds from low-performing channels to high-impact digital campaigns.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate **time series forecasting** to predict future marketing trends.
- Develop a **dashboard** for real-time performance tracking.
- Explore **causal inference methods** for deeper insights.
